Bingo Kata
=========
Each player of Bingo has a card of numbers arranged in a five-by-five grid with
five randomly-chosen numbers from 1 to 15 in the first column, from 16 to 30 in
the second column, 31 to 45 in the third column, 46 to 60 in the fourth column,
and 61 to 75 in the fifth column; the central space is "free" and is consiered
to be occupied. Then a caller randomly calls numbers from 1 to 75 without
replacement. Each player, then, marks the corresponding number, if it is present
on their card, as occupied. The first player to have five occupied numbers in a
row horizontally, in a column vertically, or along either of the two major
diagonals is the winner.

Task
=========
Your task is to write a program that will determine the average number of calls
required before a single card achieves bingo.

For bonus points: Determine the average number of calls required before any card
achieves bingo when there are at least 500 cards in play.

Input is None. Output the answer to the above questions listed in the Task
section.
